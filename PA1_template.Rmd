# Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1
First we will load the libraries that will be used for the analysis and unzip the data file if it
has not already been unzipped.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
if (!file.exists("activity.csv")) {
  unzip("activity.zip")
}
```

## Loading and preprocessing the data



## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?



## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
